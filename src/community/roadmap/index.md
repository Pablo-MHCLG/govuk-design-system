This roadmap shows what we’re working on and planning to do.

Some things on the roadmap might change – the purpose is to tell you what’s coming up and help service teams prepare and plan their own work.

See our [GitHub team board](https://github.com/orgs/alphagov/projects/53) for more details on our plans and day-to-day activities.

Last updated 19 April 2024.

## Recently shipped

We've released [GOV.UK Frontend v5.3.1](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/tag/v5.3.1) with minor bug fixes.

Previously, we’ve released [GOV.UK Frontend v5.3.0](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/tag/v5.3.0) which includes a new [Password input](/components/password-input/) component and an update to the [Character count](/components/character-count/) component’s HTML.

We've also:

- updated the crown in the header, favicon and social share images
- updated the components, patterns and styles to be compliant with WCAG 2.2
- made it easier for teams to understand [what's changed in WCAG 2.2 and what they need to do](/accessibility/wcag-2.2)
- made it easier for teams to [share their findings from user research](/community/share-research-findings/)

## Working on now

We're:

- investigating the [Navigation pattern](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/issues/76)
- planning Design System Day 2024 events
- making it easier for teams using GOV.UK Frontend to only include the components a service is using

## Coming up next

We're getting ready to:

- understand how we can better help users find what they need on the GOV.UK Design System website
- ensure the GOV.UK Design System website is compliant with WCAG 2.2
- improve the JavaScript of the Chararcter count, Tabs and Accordion components

## Future plans

We plan to:

- [drop support for Ruby Sass and LibSass](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/issues/2637) and [migrate to the Sass module system](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/issues/1791)
- explore how the [accessibile autocomplete component](https://github.com/alphagov/accessible-autocomplete) could be added to the GOV.UK Design System
- provide conventions, configs, tools and code to help users build things on top of GOV.UK Frontend
